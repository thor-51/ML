PROBLEM STATEMENT

A restaurant in sub-urban Bangalore encountered a massive case where a large group of people experienced food poisoning. Now you, an experienced government official in the food ministry, 
have received multiple texts regarding the same and need to whip up a project brief you have to submit as soon as possible to your superior. But wait, there's a twist â€“ some texts are as 
vague as your excuse for missing your assignment deadlines. Since you're obviously busy watching the latest episode of your favourite show on Netflix (and can't go through all the texts on 
your own), your mission is to now code the following:

1. You will first pre-process a finite number of random texts you will be receiving. Some of these will be the food poisoning texts.
2. Group similar texts together so that you can input them into a model. Here, all food poisoning texts should have a high probability of being grouped together. One such method which could
   be used is clustering.
3. Use keywords like "food poisoning" to detect the cluster with the food poisoning texts.
4. Input all the texts along with your own inputs into a model to generate a reasonably accurate project brief.
